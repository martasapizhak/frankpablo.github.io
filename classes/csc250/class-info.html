                  This course provides a challenging introduction to some of the core theoretical ideas that underlie the computational sciences. The objective of this course is: 

                  <li>to develop an understanding of "computer science outside the box" -- to begin to think of CS not only as the science of computers, but as the science of what can be computed. </li>

                    Demonstrate familiarity with key concepts in a procedural programming language such as: variables, data types, control structures, methods, input and output.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Demonstrate the ability to use programming to solve problems appropriate to a beginning class in programming and software development.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Acquire familiarity with rudimentary processes of software development that include: design, coding, testing, and debugging.

                    <b>Content</b>:
                    <br>

                    We'll begin with very simple computational machinery (automata and finite state machines, regular sets, context-free languages). 
                    <br><br>

                    We'll then move on to Turing machines and computability, efficient algorithms and reducibility, NP-completeness, the P versus NP problem, the power of randomness. 
                    <br><br>

                    We'll draw on real world examples from the domains of cryptography, machine learning, and more. 
                    <br><br>

                    Finally, we'll talk about the present and future of computing theory, with potential topics including interactive proofs, quantum computing and the physical limits of computation. 
                  </p>

                  <p class="mx-lg-3">
                    <b>Class mechanics</b>:
                    <br>

                    We will discuss concepts using blackboard annotations as well as proyected presentations and animations;
                    <br><br>

                    Readings will be assigned and should be completed <b>before</b> each designated lecture. <br>
                    This will help prepare you for the day's discussion.
                    <br><br>

                    Note: class participation is important, as the class will include discussion and debate about many of these topics.

                  <b>Assignments</b> - When and what are they about?
                  <br>
                  <p class="mx-lg-3">
                    There will be 8 problem sets assigned during the semester. 
                    <br><br>
                    Problem sets will be due by 5pm on (some) Wednesday evenings. 
                    <br><br>
                    These problem sets will often ask you to prove theorems, but it is more important to demonstrate understanding than to employ rigor for rigor's sake. For example: a brief description of an algorithm including an illustrative diagram is better than complicated spaghetti code. Additionally, a clear explanation of how you tried to solve a problem and were unsuccessful will receive partial credit. 
                    <br><br>
                    All assignment submissions must be in PDF format, and must be organized and legible (typed is preferable). A <a href="../resources/assignment-template.tex" download>LaTeX template</a> is available for typesetting your assignments.

                  <li>
                    When working with a group, it is essential that each group member pull their own weight, but also that other group members let them do so!

                  Throughout the class, students should focus on adhering to the following general tenets: 
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Try it! -- A common question is "will this work?", or "what will happen in this case?". The only reasonable answer is "try it and see!".
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    It is OK to make mistakes! -- an error is one learned lesson. After trying something, having that fail is as much a datapoint as a correct path. <br>
                    Note that we usually want correct paths after exploring and making a lot of errors so <i>keep looking!</i>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Ask for help when stuck! -- if you have 1) tried multiple paths and 2) you have explored the problem and made many mistakes, and you are still stuck, please seek assistance! that's what were here for! 
                    <br>
                    Believe it or not, we actually like teaching and helping you make progress.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Know your sources, and use them! -- We'll use Sipser's book and you can look for other online courses to support your learning. Be careful with online materials (like tutorials or articles): <i>they are not necessarily correct!</i>
                    Learn to use your sources productively to help to make progress.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Be proud of your submissions! -- Clarity above all. Use proper styling, simplify it where you can to make it more understandable, and comment it where appropriate. You're taking part in an art that most often is shared, and it matters if others can understand your work!
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Planning is the best problem-solving tool! -- You should not jump into writing solutions or writing code before thinking about it thoroughly. Design your solutions by breaking them into logical parts that make sense independently and when put together to make an argument.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Practice methodical analysis! -- Spend time "stepping though" your proofs and solutions, statement by statement to understand the logic behind them, and why it is logically sound (or why it was marked as incorrect). Do <b>not</b> submit a solution that you don't fully understand with the hope of flying under the radar. We look deeply at your submissions to gauge your level of understanding.
